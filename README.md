# RemoveNABlendshapes

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that add a "Remove N/A Blendshapes" button to SkinnedMeshRenderer.

## Tips
- The button will not be generated except for the session you are hosting.
- When used in conjunction with [ReloadInspectorButton](https://github.com/badhaloninja/ReloadInspectorButton), it can be used in sessions hosted by others.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [RemoveNABlendshapes.dll](https://github.com/hantabaru1014/RemoveNABlendshapes/releases/latest/download/RemoveNABlendshapes.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
